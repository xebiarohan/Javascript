1. Javascript is a dynamic, weekly typed programming language that is compiled at the runtime

2. Runs code in a browser (on a webpage)

3. How Javascript executes in the browser :

   - It uses the Javascript engine present in the browser like V8 in chrome and SpiderMonkey in firefox.
   - Engine parses the code, compiles to machine code and then executes the machine code on the webpage.
   - All runs on a single thread

4. It is a Dynamic language means it is not precompiled like Java, or C++. it is JIT compiled

5. Weekly type means no need to declare the type of variable, So same variable can be assigned 2 different data types
   example

```
        let a = 10;
        a = 'abc';
```

6. Javascript can run on a Browser or on serverside (must have an engine to interpret the JS file) (example Node.js)

7. Javascript cannot access your local file system, interact with the operating system (when running on Browser)

8. Javasfcript is based in ECMAscript. ECMAscript is managed by ECMA team. Javascript is most famous ECMAscript inplementation
